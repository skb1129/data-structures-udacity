"k" denotes results
"n" denotes texts data
"m" denotes calls data

Task 0: O(1)
Explanation: Picking all the values using index of array independent of array size.

Task 1: O(n + m)
Explanation: Iterating through all the values in texts and calls data one by one.

Task 2: O(m)
Explanation: Iterating once through all the values in calls data and performing operations.

Task 3: O(m + k log(k))
Explanation: Iterating once through all the values in calls data and performing operations including one sort.

Task 4: O(2m + n + k log(k))
Explanation: Iterating twice through calls data and once through texts data and performing a sort operation.
