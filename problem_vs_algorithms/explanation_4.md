## Explanation

The value can only be 0, 1 or 2. 0 is smallest and 2 is biggest. In one iteration over the array, put all the 0's
in the front of an array, 2's in the end of that array, and 1's in the middle.

## Design

Function uses a result array and and index variable to store the index where 1's are to be inserted in the middle.

## Big O

**O(n)**
